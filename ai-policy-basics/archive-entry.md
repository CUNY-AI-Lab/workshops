# AI Basics and Policy Statements - Workshop Archive Entry

## Workshop Overview

**Title:** AI Basics and Policy Statements  
**Date:** Tuesday, October 1, 2025  
**Duration:** 90 minutes  
**Format:** Interactive workshop with visualizations and policy drafting  
**Facilitator:** Zach Muhlbauer

## Workshop Categories

- Educational Technology
- Course Planning
- Policy Development

## Description

This workshop provides a brief introduction to generative artificial intelligence and helps instructors craft thoughtful and responsive policies for their classes. Together, we will work to demystify AI basics through interactive visualizations and hands-on tinkering, followed by discussion of sample policy statements and their implications across disciplines. Participants will draft syllabus language that represents their values as teachers and offers clear guidance on attribution, use cases, and a working definition of critical AI literacy.

## **Learning Objectives**

- Understand AI capabilities and limitations through interactive exploration
- Analyze the human cost of detection-based policies using student testimonials
- Create clear, supportive AI policies with attribution guidelines

## **Workshop Agenda:**

## **Part I: Demystifying AI Basics** (40 minutes)

### Opening: Completion Game & Free Write

**Activity:** Complete sentences and reflect on how Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini work.

**Prompts:**
- Complete sentences: "I ran to...", "Please pass...", "I slept through...", "Never have I ever...", "Intelligence is..."
- What brings you to this workshop, and what do you hope to gain from our time together?

### Neural Network Visualization

**Interactive Tool:** [https://moebio.com/mind/](https://moebio.com/mind/)

Explore how LLMs generate completions based on user input through an interactive visualization.

### A Brief Account of Artificial Intelligence

**Overview:** AI encompasses many technologies beyond chatbots:

- **Predictive AI**: attempts to infer events based on historical data (e.g., credit worthiness)
- **Computer vision**: recognizes images and patterns (e.g., facial recognition)
- **Classification systems**: sort and categorize data (e.g., content moderation)
- **Large language models**: process and generate human-like text, programming code, and structured data (e.g., Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT)
- **Generative Pretrained Transformers**: models using transformer architecture (attention mechanisms that process all words simultaneously) to generate context-aware text

### How Large Language Models (LLMs) Work

- Computationally intensive pattern-matching systems that produce text, code, and/or media
- Pretrained on billions of text examples from books, websites, articles, and software
- Processes statistical patterns in how words or snippets of code follow each other
- Uses learned patterns to process and generate responses one "token" at a time
- Output varies with prompt phrasing, structure, and composition

## **Part II: Crafting an AI Policy** (50 minutes)

### Pedagogical Differences to Flag

- Students are more liable to use AI irresponsibly when under time constraints
- Some services retain conversation history, others don't
- Data privacy policies differ significantly
- Environmental costs depend on model provider and usage type
- Free vs. paid features affect student access
- Process-based vs. detection-based approaches

### Learning from Student Testimonials

**Discussion:** Examine Reddit testimonials about the problems with AI detection:

- False positives flagging student work incorrectly
- Detection tools penalizing heightened vocabulary
- Inconsistent and unreliable detection results
- The human cost of accusation and mistrust

### Policy Components and Values

**Activity:** Discuss what makes an effective AI policy:

- Clear attribution guidelines
- Defined use cases and boundaries
- Values-based language
- Support for student learning
- Definitions of critical AI literacy

### Draft Your Syllabus Statement

**Work-on-Your-Own Activity:** Draft syllabus language that:

- Represents your values as a teacher
- Offers clear guidance on AI attribution
- Defines acceptable use cases
- Includes a working definition of critical AI literacy for your discipline
