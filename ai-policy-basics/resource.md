## Policy Crafting Framework

### Four Components of an Effective AI Policy

**1. Definition Scope**

Determines which technologies your policy covers.

Example: *For the purposes of this course, AI refers to \[define scope\].*

**2. Values Emphasis**

Defines your pedagogical priorities, connects with learning goals, and describes how you see AI's role in learning.

Example: *This course values \[state values\].*

**3. Permission Levels**

Sets terms of engagement for if, when, and how students can use AI.

Example: *Therefore, \[state permission level\]. Acceptable uses include \[list use cases\]. Discouraged uses include \[list use cases\].*

**4. Documentation Requirements**

Specifies required AI-use disclosure and attribution so that students maintain transparency with you throughout the workflow.

Example: *Any permitted AI use must be documented with \[documentation requirement\].*

## Activity: Review Syllabi Models

Lance Eaton has sourced a variety of AI syllabus statements. Select a syllabus policy that resonates with your teaching approach and adapt it.

### Focus Areas for Adaptation:

-   Definitions of AI that match your context
-   Language and permissions that align with your pedagogical values
-   Use cases relevant to your discipline
-   Documentation requirements appropriate for your assignments

## Share and Reflect

When you're ready, share your draft and respond to one of your peers: - What resonates with you about their approach? - What questions does their policy raise? - How might you adapt their ideas to your context?
