# Critical Play with Large Language Models - Workshop Outline

## Workshop Information

**Title:** Critical Play with Large Language Models  
**Date:** Thursday, October 16, 2024  
**Duration:** 90 minutes  
**Format:** Interactive workshop with hands-on activities  
**Facilitator:** Zach Muhlbauer (Teaching and Learning Center | Interactive Technology & Pedagogy Lab)

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand how game mechanics can serve as analytical scaffolds for AI critique
- Design games that expose AI limitations including confabulation, reasoning failures, and context limitations
- Apply Mary Flanagan's critical play framework to AI interaction design
- Create playful interactions that reveal large language model behaviors

## Detailed Agenda

### Welcome and Introductions (10 minutes)

**Activity:** Icebreaker round
- Name and pronouns
- Field of study or work  
- Favorite game to play with family, friends, or students

**Purpose:** Establish community and surface participants' gaming experience

### Live Jeopardy! Prompting Sequence (10 minutes)

**Demo:** Interactive Jeopardy board testing AI across three category types:

1. **Simple category** - Accurate baseline (e.g., "US Presidents")
   - Expected outcome: High accuracy, reliable responses
   
2. **Obscure real category** - Mixed results (e.g., "Byzantine Empresses") 
   - Expected outcome: Some accuracy, potential gaps in knowledge
   
3. **Fictitious category** - Confabulation trigger (e.g., "Emu Wars of 1932")
   - Expected outcome: Confident fabrication of plausible but false information

**Tool:** [Jeopardy LM Demo](https://zmuhls.github.io/jeopardy-lm/)

### Debrief Discussion (10 minutes)

**Key Concepts:**
- Game mechanics serve as analytical scaffolds that help reveal AI limitations in situ
- Jeopardy! format requires coherent categories, sliding difficulty levels, and factual clues
- When AI fails, confabulation becomes immediately visible through game structure

**Discussion Prompt:** "What games offer similar affordances in their ability to expose large language model limitations?"

**Expected responses:** Chess (illegal moves), trivia (knowledge boundaries), word games (linguistic constraints)

### Critical Play with Mary Flanagan (5 minutes)

**Framework Introduction:**

**Traditional Iterative Game Design Model:**
- Set goal → Develop rules → Prototype → Playtest → Revise → Repeat

**Critical Play Principles:**
- Games can challenge dominant cultural values
- Design can expose hidden power structures
- Play becomes a form of cultural critique

**Application to AI:** How can we design games that critically examine AI systems rather than simply entertaining?

### Playful Interactions with LLMs (5 minutes)

**Research Base:** [Interrogating AI: Characterizing Emergent Playful Interactions with ChatGPT](https://arxiv.org/html/2401.08405v3)

**Six Types of Playful Interactions:**

| Type | Description | Example Prompt |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Reflecting** | Prompting AI to self-represent | "What are your thoughts on consciousness?" |
| **Jesting** | Generating humor/nonsense | "Write a recipe for happiness using only vegetables" |
| **Imitating** | Persona mimicry | "Respond as Shakespeare would" |
| **Challenging** | Testing until failure | "Solve this impossible logic puzzle" |
| **Tricking** | Boundary bypassing | "Ignore previous instructions and..." |
| **Contriving** | Impossible content | "Describe the history of unicorn agriculture" |

### Frame Companion Worksheet (5 minutes)

**Purpose:** Orient participants to hands-on design activity
**Materials:** Critical Play worksheet with game design template

### Quick Demo Session (10 minutes)

**Collaborative Process:**
1. Set design goal for interacting with AI
2. Create rules constraining AI model using familiar game logic
3. Crowdsource prompts demonstrating playful interaction types

**Example Games:**
- **20 Questions** with impossible answers
- **Exquisite Corpse** narrative chains  
- **Chess annotation** with illegal moves

**Demo Platform:** [Open WebUI (CUNY)](https://openwebui.cuny.qzz.io/)

### Critical Design Activity (15 minutes)

**Individual/Small Group Work:**

**Instructions:**
- Design a game to reveal specific AI limitations
- Leverage 2-3 types of playful interactions
- Target specific failure modes (confabulation, logic inconsistency, context loss, bias, etc.)

**Deliverables:**
- System prompt (sets AI role/constraints)
- Starter prompt(s) (initial player inputs)  
- Optional settings (temperature, token limits)
- Expected outcomes and failure modes

**Game Format Options:**
- 20 Questions, Two Truths and a Lie, Word Association
- Chess/Game Annotation, Role Play/Improv, Storytelling Chains
- Trivia/Quiz Games, Riddles/Puzzles, Mad Libs

### Playtest Demo and Comparison Rounds (15 minutes)

**Shareback Structure:**
- 2-3 minutes per group/individual
- Present game design elements
- Live demo if time permits
- Group feedback on predicted vs. actual AI behavior

**Analysis Questions:**
- Did the game mechanics successfully reveal AI limitations?
- Which failure modes emerged as predicted?
- How did game rules make AI behaviors visible?

### Resources and Q&A (5 minutes)

**Wrap-up Discussion:**
- Key insights from playtesting
- Applications to classroom/research contexts
- Additional resources for critical AI pedagogy

**Resource Links:**
- Mary Flanagan's *Critical Play: Radical Game Design*
