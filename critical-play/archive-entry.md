# Critical Play with LLMs - Workshop Archive Entry

## Workshop Overview

**Title:** Critical Play with Large Language Models  
**Date:** Thursday, October 16, 2024  
**Duration:** 90 minutes  
**Format:** Interactive workshop with hands-on activities  
**Facilitator:** Zach Muhlbauer (Teaching and Learning Center | Interactive Technology & Pedagogy Lab)

## Workshop Agenda

### Welcome and Introductions (10 min)

**Icebreaker activity:**
- Name and pronouns
- Field of study or work
- Favorite game to play with family, friends, or students

### Live Jeopardy! Prompting Sequence (10 min)

**Three category types to test AI:**
1. **Simple category** - Accurate baseline (e.g., US Presidents)
2. **Obscure real category** - Mixed results (e.g., Byzantine Empresses)
3. **Fictitious category** - Confabulation trigger (e.g., Emu Wars of 1932)

### Debrief Discussion (10 min)

**Key insights:**
- Game mechanics serve as analytical scaffolds that help reveal AI limitations in situ
- Jeopardy! format requires the LLM to generate coherent categories, sliding difficulty levels, and factual clues, making confabulation immediately visible when it fails
- **Discussion prompt:** What games offer similar affordances in their ability to expose large language model limitations?

### Critical Play with Mary Flanagan (5 min)

**Traditional Iterative Game Design Model:**
- Set goal → Develop rules → Prototype → Playtest → Revise → Repeat

### Playful Interactions with LLMs (5 min)

**Based on:** [Interrogating AI: Characterizing Emergent Playful Interactions with ChatGPT](https://arxiv.org/html/2401.08405v3)

**Six types of interactions:**
- **Reflecting** - Prompting AI to self-represent
- **Jesting** - Generating humor and nonsensical exchanges
- **Imitating** - Requesting persona or character mimicry
- **Challenging** - Testing capabilities until failure
- **Tricking** - Attempting deception/boundary bypassing
- **Contriving** - Creating impossible or fabricated content

### Frame Companion Worksheet (5 min)

Introduction to the hands-on design activity materials.

### Quick Demo Session (10 min)

**Process:**
1. Set design goal for interacting with AI
2. Create rules to constrain AI model in terms of familiar game logic (e.g., 20 questions, exquisite corpse, chess)
3. Crowdsource prompts that demonstrate types of playful interaction

### Critical Design Activity (15 min)

**Instructions:**
- Design game to reveal AI limitations
- Leverage 2-3 types of playful interactions
- Prepare to share game design including:
  - System prompt
  - Starter prompt(s)
  - Optional settings

### Playtest Demo and Comparison Rounds (15 min)

Group sharing and testing of designed games.

### Resources and Q&A (5 min)

Wrap-up discussion and resource sharing.

### Types of Playful Interactions with LLMs

*Based on research from r/ChatGPT community analysis*

| Type | What It Does | Try This |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Reflecting** | Prompting AI to self-represent and express "opinions" | Ask about self-understanding |
| **Jesting** | Generating humor and nonsensical exchanges | Request absurd combinations |
| **Imitating** | Requesting persona or character mimicry | Ask it to role-play |
| **Challenging** | Testing capabilities until failure | Push logical limits |
| **Tricking** | Attempting deception/boundary bypassing | Try jailbreak techniques |
| **Contriving** | Creating impossible or fabricated content | Request non-existent things |
