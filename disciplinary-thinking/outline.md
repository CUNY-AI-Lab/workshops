# AI Literacy and Disciplinary Thinking - Workshop Outline

## Workshop Information

**Title:** AI Literacy and Disciplinary Thinking  
**Date:** Monday, March 4, 2024  
**Time:** 3:00-4:30 PM  
**Duration:** 90 minutes  
**Format:** Hyflex (Zoom and in-person, Room 3317)  
**Facilitators:** Zach Muhlbauer and Manju Adikesevan

## Workshop Description

Instructors teaching with artificial intelligence face critical issues in data privacy, intellectual property, and algorithmic bias. This workshop helps participants learn how these concerns can inform the selection of AI tools suitable for their discipline and how to impart similar AI literacies to their students.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:
- Define AI literacy within their specific discipline
- Apply the four A's framework (Application, Agency, Authenticity, Accountability) to course assignments
- Revise existing assignments to integrate relevant AI literacies
- Develop policies and expectations for AI use in their courses

## Detailed Agenda

### Part 1: Group Brainstorm - Taking Inventory of AI Tools (20 minutes)

**Activity:** Define AI literacy for teaching in specific disciplines

**Process:**
- Discuss and draw connections between disciplinary definitions of AI literacy
- Explore how AI tools have different affordances that can be customized to disciplinary contexts

**Discussion Prompts:**
- What AI platforms do you know of besides ChatGPT? (Poll Everywhere + Word Cloud)
- How are they relevant to your discipline? (Group Discussion)
- Where do you see the need for AI literacies when teaching your discipline? (Group Discussion)

### Part 2: AI Literacy Framework Presentation (40 minutes)

**Overview:** Walk through AI literacy framework focusing on four key capabilities: Application, Agency, Authenticity, and Accountability. Participants will adapt this framework to assignments in their discipline.

**Framework Activity:**
1. Select an assignment you have taught in the past
2. Choose one AI tool to support a specific stage of that assignment

#### The Four A's Framework

**1. Application** - Using AI tools aligned with the task at hand

Key considerations:
- Helping students decide which AI tool to use for different tasks
- Assessing the capabilities and limitations of that tool within their discipline
- Establishing best practices for optimizing students' use of that tool (e.g., specific commands, prompts, or queries)
- Scrutinizing the dataset on which the tool is trained

*Discussion Prompt:* How will students apply the AI tool to a specific stage of your assignment?

**2. Agency** - Students retaining control over their learning process

Key considerations:
- Assessing whether use of AI enables students to retain or expand personal choices
- Ensuring students use AI intentionally to expand their knowledge and skills
- Empowering students to make independent decisions while using AI for assistance

*Discussion Prompt:* How can students use the AI tool to expand knowledge or skills relevant to your assignment?

**3. Authenticity** - Centering genuine human communication and interaction

Key considerations:
- Fostering intrinsic motivation among students to express their own voice or style
- Engaging students in interest-driven learning that promotes authentic participation
- Encouraging students to build trust and credibility as part of their use of AI tools

*Discussion Prompt:* How can students express their own voice or style in their use of AI for your assignment?

**4. Accountability** - Taking responsibility for AI-influenced content and using generative AI fairly and equitably

Key considerations:
- Guiding students to factually verify and take responsibility for AI content
- Ensuring AI tools used to support work provide equal access to all stakeholders
- Teaching how to properly cite and attribute AI tools within specific disciplines

*Discussion Prompt:* How can students expect to be held accountable for their use of AI in response to your assignment?

### Part 3: Assignment Makeover Activity (30 minutes)

**Individual Work:** Revise an existing assignment to integrate AI literacies

**Instructions:**
1. Pick one assignment you are currently using in your course
2. Revise the assignment instructions/parameters to reflect AI literacies relevant to your discipline
3. Craft assignment instructions about instructor policies and expectations around the use of AI for the assignment

**Deliverables:**
- Revised assignment with integrated AI literacy components
- Clear policy statements for AI use expectations
- Application of the Four A's framework to the specific assignment context

### Wrap-Up and Sharing (5 minutes)

**Activity:** Brief sharing of revised assignments and key insights
**Discussion:** Questions and next steps for implementing AI literacy in courses

## Materials Needed

- Shared document or collaborative board for brainstorming
- Poll Everywhere setup for interactive polling
- Assignment template for makeover activity
- Four A's framework reference sheet

## Assessment

**Formative Assessment:**
- Participation in group discussions and brainstorming
- Quality of assignment revision incorporating AI literacy principles
- Demonstration of understanding of the Four A's framework

**Workshop Success Indicators:**
- Participants can articulate AI literacy within their disciplinary context
- Revised assignments effectively integrate multiple aspects of AI literacy
- Clear policies and expectations developed for AI use in courses
