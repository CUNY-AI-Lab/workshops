# AI Literacy and Disciplinary Thinking - Workshop Outline

## Workshop Information

**Title:** AI Literacy and Disciplinary Thinking  
**Date:** Monday, March 4, 2024  
**Time:** 3:00-4:30 PM  
**Duration:** 90 minutes  
**Format:** Hyflex (Zoom and in-person, Room 3317)  
**Facilitators:** Zach Muhlbauer and Manju Adikesevan

## Workshop Description

Instructors teaching with artificial intelligence face critical issues in data privacy, intellectual property, and algorithmic bias. This workshop helps participants learn how these concerns can inform the selection of AI tools suitable for their discipline and how to impart similar AI literacies to their students.

## Detailed Agenda

### Part 1: Group Brainstorm - Taking Inventory of AI Tools (20 minutes)

**Activity:** Prompt attendees to define what AI literacy entails for teaching in their specific discipline

**Process:**
- Discuss and draw connections between their disciplinary definitions of AI literacy
- Explore how AI tools have different affordances that can be customized to disciplinary contexts

**Discussion Prompts:**
- What AI platforms do you know of besides ChatGPT? (Poll Everywhere + Word Cloud)

-   How are they relevant to your discipline? (Group Discussion)

-   Where do you see the need for AI literacies when teaching your discipline? (Group Discussion)

**Part 2**

(40 minutes, 8 slides)

**Presentation (with Q&A interspersed): AI Literacy Framework**

**AI Literacy Framework**: Walk through AI literacy framework with attention to four sets of capabilities --- application, authenticity, accountability, and agency --- for attendees to adapt to assignments used to teach their discipline.

> **Prompts**:

1.  Select an assignment you have taught in the past and one AI tool to support a specific stage of that assignment

**Application** involves knowing how to use AI tools that are aligned with the task at hand

-   Helping students decide which AI tool to use for different tasks

-   Assessing the capabilities and limitations of that tool within their discipline

-   Establishing best practices for optimizing students' use of that tool (e.g. use of specific commands, prompts, or queries)

-   Scrutinizing the data set on which the tool is trained

> **Prompt**:

1.  How will students apply the AI tool to a specific stage of your assignment?

**Agency** involves students retaining control over their learning process

-   Assessing whether use of AI enables students to retain or expand personal choices

-   Ensuring students use AI intentionally to expand their knowledge and skills

-   Empowering students to make independent decisions while using AI for assistance

> **Prompt**: How can students use the AI tool to expand knowledge or skills relevant to your assignment?

**Authenticity** involves centering genuine human communication and interaction

-   Fostering intrinsic motivation among students to express their own voice or style

-   Engaging students in interest-driven learning that promotes authentic participation

-   Encouraging students to build trust and credibility as part of their use of AI tools

> **Prompt**: How can students express their own voice or style in their use of AI for your assignment?

**Accountability** involves taking responsibility for AI-influenced content and using generative AI in a fair and equitable manner within specific disciplines

-   Guiding students to factually verify and take responsibility for AI content

-   Ensuring AI tools used to support work provide equal access to all stakeholders

-   Teaching how to properly cite and attribute AI tools within specific disciplines

> **Prompt**: How can student expect to be held accountable for their use of AI in response to your assignment?

**Work-on-your-own activity: Assignment Makeover**

-   Attendees will pick one assignment they are currently using in their course

-   Revise the assignment instructions/parameters to reflect AI literacies relevant to their discipline

-   Craft assignment instructions about instructors policies and expectations around the use of AI for the assignment
