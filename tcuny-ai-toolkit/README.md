## About the AI Toolkit

The Teach@CUNY AI Toolkit is designed to help CUNY instructors navigate and critically engage with artificial intelligence in educational settings. The toolkit supports students and faculty in understanding AI's complexities, ethical implications, and pedagogical challenges.

Rather than viewing AI as mere technology, the toolkit approaches AI as a subject requiring critical engagement from students, faculty, and staff. The goal is to help users "navigate a world increasingly awash in AI" while maintaining a critical and thoughtful perspective.

## Core Provocations

The toolkit encourages critical thinking about AI through five core provocations:

1. **Understanding AI's historical context** - Situating current AI developments within broader technological and social history
2. **Examining the human data behind AI training** - Recognizing the labor and data sources that power AI systems
3. **Recognizing AI's inherent biases** - Understanding how training data and design choices embed bias
4. **Understanding AI's lack of self-awareness** - Acknowledging the limitations of current AI systems
5. **Recognizing the importance of thoughtful AI engagement** - Emphasizing critical rather than uncritical adoption

## Toolkit Resources

The toolkit provides practical guidance through key sections:

- **About AI** - Explains basic AI concepts and recent generative AI technologies
- **Course Policy** - Provides ethical guidelines for AI use in education
- **Assignment Makeovers** - Helps redesign assignments considering AI tools
- **Sample Activities** - Offers AI-related classroom activities
- **Learn More** - Provides resources, campus support information, and assignment libraries

## Connection to CUNY AI Lab Workshops

- **Resource Continuity** - Bridging workshop experiences with ongoing faculty development
- **Policy Alignment** - Ensuring workshops support CUNY's mission and values
- **Community Building** - Fostering collaboration among AI-interested faculty across campuses

## Philosophical Approach

The Teach@CUNY AI Toolkit emphasizes:

- **Critical Engagement** - Moving beyond tool use to understand AI's complexities and implications
- **Thoughtful Integration** - Encouraging deliberate rather than uncritical adoption of AI
