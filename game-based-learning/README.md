# AI Literacy and Game-Based Learning

_A CUNY AI Lab workshop introducing game-based strategies for teaching with and about artificial intelligence._

This workshop introduces game-based strategies for developing students' AI literacy through interactive storytelling, collaborative problem solving, doodling, and notecard exercises. Participants learn how to teach methods of prompt engineering by designing—and playing—their own choose-your-own-adventure games.

**Workshop Date:** Wednesday, October 16, 2024
**Duration:** 90 minutes (2:00-3:30 PM)
**Format:** In-person (Room 3317)
**Facilitator:** Zach Muhlbauer

_This workshop was originally conducted as part of the Teaching and Learning Center at the CUNY Graduate Center._

## About the CUNY AI Lab

The **CUNY AI Lab** is a faculty and staff-led incubator for experimentation with AI by CUNY researchers across disciplines, strengthening CUNY's position at the leading edge of technological innovation. Located at the CUNY Graduate Center and led by experienced scholars and technologists who have built widely used open publishing platforms, the Lab fosters momentum for AI experimentation while foregrounding ethical practices and values that reinforce CUNY's mission of accessible, equitable, and transformative education.

This workshop is part of the CUNY AI Lab's commitment to developing critical AI literacy among faculty, staff, and students across the university system.

## Overview

Game-based learning can foster critical thinking as well as creative, hands-on engagement with AI tools in the classroom. This workshop demonstrates how interactive games can help students develop nuanced understanding of AI capabilities and limitations while building practical prompting skills.

## Workshop Agenda

### Part I: Freewrite and Framing

**Reflection prompts:**
- What brings you to this workshop today?
- How would you describe your understanding of AI literacy?

**Key Components of AI Literacy:**
- **Ethical Engagement:** Recognizing and addressing issues of bias, fairness, and transparency in AI
- **Power & Control:** Examining who builds, owns, and benefits from AI systems, including their role in surveillance and labor dynamics
- **Bias & Representation:** Understanding how AI can reproduce societal inequalities through biased data
- **Participation & Agency:** Empowering individuals to shape the future of AI through informed decision-making and civic engagement

### Part II: AI Pictionary - Understanding Primitives

**Thinking about Primitives:**

Primitives = the smallest processing unit of an AI model

> "I think about… primitives as being akin to a pencil or brushstroke. A specific pattern of pencil strokes makes a face, a different pattern makes a banana. It took me a while to wrap my head around this: the process is very similar to how you learn to draw.
>
> You learn your basic 'primitive' or generic shapes. You draw a circle, an ellipse, a triangle, a square, and so on, and then you conjoin them into more complex objects and images. These are the basic building blocks of drawing. As you evolve as an artist, you tend to forget that this was how you thought about images, but it is also how neural networks operate while they are being trained: the generation of primitives, where an image is broken down into its component parts, will be used as the basis for assembling more and more complicated images in a machine learning system."
>
> — Trevor Paglen, _Adversarially Evolved Hallucinations_

**Activity:** Doodle six consecutive images (2 minutes)
- Pay attention to the component parts of the drawing
- Which features make the drawing more or less recognizable?
- What are its primitives?

**Datasets explored:**
- Zigzag
- Snowflake
- Apple
- Compass
- Animal migration
- Camouflage

**Analysis questions:**
- **Modeling:** How do drawings from the dataset compare with your own?
- **Variability:** Is the dataset what you expected? Is it consistent or variable?
- **Tails:** Are there outliers or edge cases? Why might the model struggle to identify them?

**Play:** Quick, Draw It! (Google's interactive game)
- How do you draw differently on your own compared to the model?
- How does the model reshape your sense of the image while you draw it?
- What about the broader project interests you or raises an eyebrow?

### Part III: Companion Resource

**Questions for discussion:**
- Why should students think about AI models in terms of their latent processes?
- How can we use games to develop students' critical judgement of AI technologies?

**Activity:** Annotate the companion resource (AI Literacy & Game-Based Learning.pdf)
- Frontside: thoughts on prompting methods and their examples
- Backside: questions or ideas about the workshop

### Part IV: Prompt Your Own Adventure Game

**Prompting ChatGPT-4o to serve as an interactive text adventure game:**

**Zero Shot:**
```
[action verb] a scaffolded text-based adventure game where I explore a haunted castle to learn about AI literacy
```

**Few Shot:**
```
[action verb] a scaffolded text-based adventure game where I explore a haunted castle to learn about AI literacy in terms of the key components listed here:
- Ethical Engagement
- Power & Control
- Bias & Representation
- Participation & Agency
```

**Choose verbs that generate different outputs:**
- Run a scaffolded text-based adventure game...
- Craft a scaffolded text-based adventure game...

**Collaborative Prompting:**

Invite group to fill in template for text adventure game with ChatGPT-4o. Frame it as a game of exquisite corpse.

**Prompt Template:**
```
Design a [genre] adventure game where the player assumes the role of [character or role]. The game begins with [starting scenario], and at each decision point, the player is presented with [number] choices that will affect [specific outcomes].

Each choice should lead to [different narrative branches or consequences], while keeping [key theme or challenge] core to the experience.

Ensure that the game's structure maintains [specific pacing, tension, or level of difficulty], and incorporate [additional elements like puzzles, ethical dilemmas, or critical provocations].
```

**Example: MTA Adventure Game**
```
Design a modern MTA adventure game where the player assumes the role of a student navigating New York City's subway system for the first time. The game begins with the player standing in front of a subway entrance, holding a MetroCard.

At each decision point, the player is presented with 3 choices that affect their ability to reach their destination on time. Each choice should lead to different narrative branches—such as taking the wrong train, asking for directions, or figuring out how to transfer—while keeping the theme of learning public transit core to the experience.

Ensure that the game's structure teaches essential skills like reading the subway map, understanding express vs. local trains, and handling delays, while incorporating challenges like rush hour crowds or service changes.
```

### Conclusions

**Put it into practice:** Draft, run, and refine your own text adventure prompt!
