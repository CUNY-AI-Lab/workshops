## Detailed Agenda

### Part I: Freewrite and Framing

-   What brings you to this workshop today?

-   How would you describe your understanding of AI literacy?

**Key Components of AI Literacy**:

-   Ethical Engagement: Recognizing and addressing issues of bias, fairness, and transparency in AI

-   Power & Control: Examining who builds, owns, and benefits from AI systems, including their role in surveillance and labor dynamics

-   Bias & Representation: Understanding how AI can reproduce societal inequalities through biased data

-   Participation & Agency: Empowering individuals to shape the future of AI through informed decision-making and civic engagement

**Thinking about Primitives**

Primitives = the smallest processing unit of an AI model

> "I think about... **primitives** as being akin to a pencil or brushstroke. A specific pattern of pencil strokes makes a face, a different pattern makes a banana. It took me a while to wrap my head around this: the process is very similar to how you learn to draw.
>
> You learn your basic \"**primitive**\" or generic shapes. You draw a circle, an ellipse, a triangle, a square, and so on, and then you conjoin them into more complex objects and images. These are the basic building blocks of drawing. As you evolve as an artist, you tend to forget that this was how you thought about images, but it is also how **neural networks** operate while they are being trained: the generation of primitives, where an image is broken down into its component parts, will be used as the basis for assembling more and more complicated images in a machine learning system."

-   Trevor Paglen*, Adversially Evolved Hallucinations*

### Part II: AI Pictionary

**First**: draw doodles of the images as they appear on the big screen (2 mins). Pay attention to the component parts of the drawing---which features make the drawing more or less recognizable? What are its primitives?

4.  Camouflage: <https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data/camouflage>

5.  Animal migration: <https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data/animal_migration>

**Next**: look at the dataset for an image you drew

-   **Modeling**: In which ways are drawings from the dataset similar or different from your own?

-   **Variability**: Is the dataset what you expected? Is it fairly consistent or subject to variation?

-   **Tails**: Where are there outliers or edge cases? Why could the model struggle to identify them?

**Lastly**: play *Quick, Draw It!* first as a group, then again individually on a mobile device or laptop. Consider the questions below as you play:

1.  How do you draw differently on your own compared to the model?

2.  How does the model reshape your sense of the image while you draw it?

3.  What about the broader project interests you or raises an eyebrow?

### Part III. Debrief and Transition

**Review takeaways**: Recap how this drawing exercise can help students visualize AI's latent processes (e.g. training sets, data inputs, model outputs), lowering the barrier to technical engagement while fostering critical and creative exploration in the process.

**Questions to consider**:

-   Why should students think about AI technologies in terms of their latent processes?

-   How can we use games to facilitate critical yet playful explorations of artificial intelligence?

1.  Annotate frontside with your thoughts on prompting methods and their examples

2.  Add notes to the backside with any questions or ideas you have so far about the workshop

### Part IV. Prompt Your Own Adventure Game

Prompting ChatGPT-4o to serve as an interactive text adventure game:

    -   Ethical Engagement

    -   Power & Control

    -   Bias & Representation

    -   Participation & Agency

**Collaborative Prompting**

Invite group to complete prompt template for text adventure game with ChatGPT-4o on shared screen:

1.  Prompt Template: Text Adventure Game

> *Design a \[**genre**\] adventure game where the player assumes the role of \[**character or role**\]. The game begins with \[**starting scenario**\], and at each decision point, the player is presented with \[**number**\] choices that will affect \[**specific outcomes**\].*
>
> *Each choice should lead to \[**different narrative branches or consequences**\], while keeping \[**key theme or challenge**\] core to the experience.*
>
> *Ensure that the game's structure maintains \[**specific pacing, tension, or level of difficulty**\], and incorporate \[**additional elements like puzzles, ethical dilemmas, or critical provocations**\].*

2.  Prompt Example: MTA Adventure Game

> *Design a modern MTA adventure game where the player assumes the role of a student navigating New York City's subway system for the first time. The game begins with the player standing in front of a subway entrance, holding a MetroCard.*
>
> *At each decision point, the player is presented with 3 choices that affect their ability to reach their destination on time. Each choice should lead to different narrative branches---such as taking the wrong train, asking for directions, or figuring out how to transfer---while keeping the theme of learning public transit core to the experience.*
>
> *Ensure that the game's structure teaches essential skills like reading the subway map, understanding express vs. local trains, and handling delays, while incorporating challenges like rush hour crowds or service changes.*

**Conclusions**:**\
**Put it into practice---draft, run, and refine your own text adventure prompt.
