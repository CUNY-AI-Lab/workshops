## Description

This workshop introduces game-based strategies for teaching with and about artificial intelligence. Participants learn how to develop students' AI literacy through interactive storytelling, collaborative problem solving, doodling, and notecard exercises. The workshop covers methods of prompt engineering by designing and playing choose-your-own-adventure games, demonstrating how game-based learning can foster critical thinking as well as creative, hands-on engagement with AI tools in the classroom.

## Workshop Agenda

### Part I: Freewrite and Framing

**Reflection Prompts:**
- What brings you to this workshop today?
- How would you describe your understanding of AI literacy?

**Key Components of AI Literacy:**
- **Ethical Engagement:** Recognizing and addressing issues of bias, fairness, and transparency in AI
- **Power & Control:** Examining who builds, owns, and benefits from AI systems, including their role in surveillance and labor dynamics
- **Bias & Representation:** Understanding how AI can reproduce societal inequalities through biased data
- **Participation & Agency:** Empowering individuals to shape the future of AI through informed decision-making and civic engagement

**Thinking about Primitives**:

Primitives = the smallest processing unit of an AI model

> "I think about... **primitives** as being akin to a pencil or
> brushstroke. A specific pattern of pencil strokes makes a face, a
> different pattern makes a banana. It took me a while to wrap my head
> around this: the process is very similar to how you learn to draw.
>
> You learn your basic \"**primitive**\" or generic shapes. You draw a
> circle, an ellipse, a triangle, a square, and so on, and then you
> conjoin them into more complex objects and images. These are the basic
> building blocks of drawing. As you evolve as an artist, you tend to
> forget that this was how you thought about images, but it is also how
> **neural networks** operate while they are being trained: the
> generation of primitives, where an image is broken down into its
> component parts, will be used as the basis for assembling more and
> more complicated images in a machine learning system."

— Trevor Paglen, *Adversarially Evolved Hallucinations*

### Part II: AI Pictionary

**Activity:** Doodle six consecutive images as they appear on screen (2 minutes)

Pay attention to the component parts of the drawing — which features make the drawing more or less recognizable? What are its primitives?

**Drawing Sequence** (twenty seconds per doodle, roughly increasing in variance):

2. **Snowflake:** [https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data/snowflake](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data/snowflake)
3. **Apple:** [https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data/apple](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data/apple)
4. **Compass:** [https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data/compass](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data/compass)
5. **Animal migration:** [https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data/animal_migration](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data/animal_migration)
6. **Camouflage:** [https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data/camouflage](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data/camouflage)

**Dataset Analysis:** Look at the dataset for one of your hand-drawn doodles:

- **Modeling:** How do drawings from the dataset compare with your own?
- **Variability:** Is the dataset what you expected? Is it consistent or variable?
- **Tails:** Are there outliers or edge cases? Why might the model struggle to identify them?

**Interactive Play:** Play *Quick, Draw It!* either as a group or individually on a mobile device or personal laptop. Consider these questions:

1. How do you draw differently on your own compared to the model?
2. How does the model reshape your sense of the image while you draw it?
3. What about the broader project interests you or raises an eyebrow?

### Part III: Companion Resource

**Discussion Questions:**
- Why should students think about AI models in terms of their latent processes?
- How can we use games to develop students' critical judgement of AI technologies?

**Activity:** Turn to the companion resource: [AI Literacy & Game-Based Learning.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B_pfrMeJriZcsVK8L-AA4cHa9HS11rr9/view?usp=sharing)

1. Annotate frontside with your thoughts on prompting methods and their examples
2. Add notes to the backside with any questions or ideas you have so far about the workshop

**Part IV. Prompt Your Own Adventure Game**

Prompting ChatGPT-4o to serve as an interactive text adventure game:

-   [Zero Shot](https://chatgpt.com/share/670e786f-bc18-8002-9bec-e59173390332): \[***action verb***\] *a scaffolded text-based adventure game where I explore a haunted castle to learn about AI literacy*

-   [Few Shot](https://chatgpt.com/share/670e786f-bc18-8002-9bec-e59173390332): \[**action verb**\] a scaffolded text-based adventure game where I explore a haunted castle to learn about AI literacy in terms of the key components listed here:

    -   Ethical Engagement
    -   Power & Control
    -   Bias & Representation
    -   Participation & Agency

Choose verbs that are sure to generate different outputs with an LLM
like ChatGPT-4o:

-   ***Run** a scaffolded text-based adventure game...*

-   ***Craft** a scaffolded text-based adventure game...*

**Collaborative Prompting**

Invite group to fill in template for text adventure game with ChatGPT-4o
on shared screen. Break it down as you go, soliciting input for the
group; frame it as a game of [exquisite corpse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse), even.

1.  **Prompt Template**: Text Adventure Game

> *Design a \[**genre**\] adventure game where the player assumes the
> role of \[**character or role**\]. The game begins with \[**starting
> scenario**\], and at each decision point, the player is presented with
> \[**number**\] choices that will affect \[**specific outcomes**\].*
>
> *Each choice should lead to \[**different narrative branches or
> consequences**\], while keeping \[**key theme or challenge**\] core to
> the experience.*
>
> *Ensure that the game's structure maintains \[**specific pacing,
> tension, or level of difficulty**\], and incorporate \[**additional
> elements like puzzles, ethical dilemmas, or critical
> provocations**\].*

2.  **Prompt Example**: MTA Adventure Game

> *Design a modern MTA adventure game where the player assumes the role
> of a student navigating New York City's subway system for the first
> time. The game begins with the player standing in front of a subway
> entrance, holding a MetroCard.*
>
> *At each decision point, the player is presented with 3 choices that
> affect their ability to reach their destination on time. Each choice
> should lead to different narrative branches---such as taking the wrong
> train, asking for directions, or figuring out how to transfer---while
> keeping the theme of learning public transit core to the experience.*
>
> *Ensure that the game's structure teaches essential skills like
> reading the subway map, understanding express vs. local trains, and
> handling delays, while incorporating challenges like rush hour crowds
> or service changes.*

**Conclusions**:

Put it into practice---draft, run, and refine your own text adventure prompt!
