## Prompting Methods Overview

This companion resource introduces prompting methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) and their application in game-based learning scenarios.

### Key Prompting Techniques

**Zero-Shot Prompting**

Providing a direct instruction without examples:

Example: \[**action verb**\] a scaffolded text-based adventure game where I explore a haunted castle to learn about AI literacy

**Few-Shot Prompting**

Providing context and examples to guide the model:

Example: \[**action verb**\] a scaffolded text-based adventure game where I explore a haunted castle to learn about AI literacy in terms of the key components listed here: - Ethical Engagement - Power & Control - Bias & Representation - Participation & Agency

### Action Verb Selection

Different action verbs produce varied outputs with LLMs: - **Run** a scaffolded text-based adventure game... - **Craft** a scaffolded text-based adventure game... - **Design** a scaffolded text-based adventure game... - **Build** a scaffolded text-based adventure game...

## Activity: Annotate and Reflect

### Frontside Activity

Review the prompting methods and examples. Add your thoughts: - Which methods seem most applicable to your discipline? - What variations could you try? - How might students benefit from understanding these techniques?

### Backside Activity

Add notes with questions or ideas: - How can game-based learning develop AI literacy? - What other prompting scenarios could work for your students? - What concerns or opportunities do you see?

## Text Adventure Game Template

**Prompt Structure:**

> *Design a \[**genre**\] adventure game where the player assumes the role of \[**character or role**\]. The game begins with \[**starting scenario**\], and at each decision point, the player is presented with \[**number**\] choices that will affect \[**specific outcomes**\].*
>
> *Each choice should lead to \[**different narrative branches or consequences**\], while keeping \[**key theme or challenge**\] core to the experience.*
>
> *Ensure that the game's structure maintains \[**specific pacing, tension, or level of difficulty**\], and incorporate \[**additional elements like puzzles, ethical dilemmas, or critical provocations**\].*

### Example: MTA Adventure Game

> *Design a modern MTA adventure game where the player assumes the role of a student navigating New York City's subway system for the first time. The game begins with the player standing in front of a subway entrance, holding a MetroCard.*
>
> *At each decision point, the player is presented with 3 choices that affect their ability to reach their destination on time. Each choice should lead to different narrative branches---such as taking the wrong train, asking for directions, or figuring out how to transfer---while keeping the theme of learning public transit core to the experience.*
>
> *Ensure that the game's structure teaches essential skills like reading the subway map, understanding express vs.Â local trains, and handling delays, while incorporating challenges like rush hour crowds or service changes.*

## Your Turn

Draft, run, and refine your own text adventure prompt for your discipline or teaching context.
